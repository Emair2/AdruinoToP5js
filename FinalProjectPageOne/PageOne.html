    <h1>Wind Wave ðŸŒŠ</h1>
    <p>The great majority of large breakers seen at a beach result from distant winds.</p>
    <p>Five factors influence the formation of the flow structures in wind waves:</p>
       <p> 1. Wind speed or strength relative to wave speed;</p>
       <p>2. The wind blows without significant change in direction;</p>
       <p>3. Width of the area affected by fetch;</p>
       <p>4. The time for which the wind has blown over the water;</p>
       <p>5. Water depth.</p>
